# lasermicrophone_signalprocessing
This repository contains a complete MATLAB digital signal processing (DSP) pipeline for a laser-based microphone system. The scripts perform noise reduction, filtering, and spectral enhancement on audio signals captured by a photodiode receiver in a laser listening setup.
